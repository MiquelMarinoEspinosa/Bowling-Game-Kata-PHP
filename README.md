# Rules

The game consists of 10 frames. In each frame the player has two rolls to knock down 10 pins. The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two rolls. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.
A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first roll. The frame is then completed with a single roll. The bonus for that frame is the value of the next two rolls.
In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra balls to complete the frame. However no more than three balls can be rolled in tenth frame.

# Requirements
Write a class `Game` that has two methods

`void roll(int)` is called each time the player rolls a ball. The argument is the number of pins knocked down.

`int score()` returns the total score for that game.

# Follow up
It has been added the [Robert C. Martin](BowlingGameKata.pdf) solution in the code base in pdf format 

# Development environment
- It requires `docker`
- Execute the following commands

```
$> make build
$> make up
$> make install 
```

- To execute the tests execute
```
$> make tests
```

- To generate the coverage at the `build/coverage` folder execute
```
$> make coverage
```

- The solution kata will be implemented and explained at the `README.md` file at the `solution` branch

# Solution
- The whole solution will be implemented following the `TDD` strategy
- For each implementation the 3 `TDD` steps will be explained in detail
    - `RED` -> fail, writing a failing test
    - `GREEN` -> fix, make the test pass quick
    - `BLUE` -> refactor, clean up the code and introduce any design if it is required
    - `NONE` -> refactor and fixes which are manly related to mistakes, findings or adding documentation out of the `TDD` process
- At every step the code coverage will be checked
- Let's start creating unit tests considering that the `Game` has a single frame and cover all the logic for a single frame
    - Edge cases
        - The `Game` does not accept negative `pins` for the `roll` method
            - `RED`: Write one unit test for the `roll` method passing negative `pins` value. Notice that the `roll` method does not even exist at this point
            - `GREEN`: Add method `roll` at `Game` class and throw an exception
            - `BLUE`: Nothing to refactor at this point. Let's continue :)
        - The `Game` allow to roll `1` `pin`
            - `RED`: write one unit test for the `roll` method passing `1` as num of `pins` parameter. Also the test would call to the not existent yet `score` method
            - `GREEN`: 
                - fix the test fast, adding a safe guard to check whether the `pins` is negative to throw the exception 
                - implement `score` method returning `1`
            - `BLUE`:
                - refactor `GameTest` to use `setUp` method to create the `Game` sut
                - implements early return at `Game roll` method in case positive or zero number
        - The `Game` does not allow more than `10` pins to be rolled
            - `RED`: Falling test try to `roll` more than `10` pins
